Cotton lived high up in a nice warm place above the barn where all of the farmer's horses slept. But Cotton wasn't alone in her little home above the barn, oh no. She shared her hay bed with her mommy and 5 other sisters. All of her sisters were cute and fluffy, like Cotton. But she was the only white one in the bunch. The rest of her sisters were all orange with beautiful white tiger stripes like Cotton's mommy. Being different made Cotton quite sad. She often wished she looked like the rest of her family. So one day, when Cotton found a can of the old farmer's orange paint, she used it to paint herself like them. When her mommy and sisters found her they started laughing. \\n\\n\\\"What are you doing, Cotton?!\\\" \\n\\n\\\"I only wanted to be more like you\\\". \\n\\nCotton's mommy rubbed her face on Cotton's and said \\\"Oh Cotton, but your fur is so pretty and special, like you. We would never want you to be any other way\\\". And with that, Cotton's mommy picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When Cotton came out she was herself again. Her sisters licked her face until Cotton's fur was all all dry. \\n\\n\\\"Don't ever do that again, Cotton!\\\" they all cried. \\\"Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn't want that!\\\" \\n\\nThen Cotton thought, \\\"I change my mind. I like being special\\\".\",\n",

They played all day long. \\n\\nOne day, a bottle floated by over the heads of Asta and his friends. They looked up and saw the bottle. \\\"What is it?\\\" said Asta's friend Sharkie. \\\"It looks like a bird's belly,\\\" said Asta. But when they swam closer, it was not a bird's belly. It was hard and clear, and there was something inside it. \\n\\nThe bottle floated above them. They wanted to open it. They wanted to see what was inside. So they caught the bottle and carried it down to the bottom of the ocean. They cracked it open on a rock. When they got it open, they found what was inside. It was a note. The note was written in orange crayon on white paper. Asta could not read the note. Sharkie could not read the note. They took the note to Asta's papa. \\\"What does it say?\\\" they asked. \\n\\nAsta's papa read the note. He told Asta and Sharkie, \\\"This note is from a little girl. She wants to be your friend. If you want to be her friend, we can write a note to her. But you have to find another bottle so we can send it to her.\\\" And that is what they did.\",\n",

      "            \"story\": \"My doorbell rings. On the step, I find the elderly Chinese lady, small and slight, holding the hand of a little boy. In her other hand, she holds a paper carrier bag. \\n\\nI know this lady. It is not her first visit. She is the boy's grandmother, and her daughter bought the house next door last October. \\n\\nHer daughter, Nicole, speaks fluent English. But she is now in Shanghai, and her parents are here with the little boy. Nicole has obviously told her mother that I am having heart surgery soon, so her mother has decided I need more nutrients. \\n\\nI know what is inside the bag--a thermos with hot soup and a stainless-steel container with rice, vegetables and either chicken, meat or shrimp, sometimes with a kind of pancake. This has become an almost-daily practice. \\n\\nCommunication between us is somewhat affected by the fact that she doesn't speak English and all I can say in Chinese is hello. Once, she brought an iPad as well as the food. She pointed to the screen, which displayed a message from her daughter telling me that her mother wanted to know if the food was all right and whether it was too salty. I am not used to iPads, so she indicated I should go with her to her house. Then, she handed the iPad to her husband and almost immediately I found myself looking at Nicole in Shanghai and discussing her mother's cooking and salt intake. Instantly, tears welled in my eyes. \\n\\n\\\"Your mother just can't be bringing me meals like this all the time,\\\" I insisted. \\\"I can hardly do dishes in return.\\\" \\n\\n\\\"Oh, no, Lucy.\\\" Nicole said. \\\"Mum doesn't like western food. Don't worry about it; she has to cook for the three of them anyway, and she wants to do it.\\\" \\n\\nThe doorbell keeps ringing and there is the familiar brown paper carrier bag, handed smilingly to me. \\n\\nI am now working on some more Chinese words--it's the least I can do after such display of kindness. \\n\\n\\\"Thank you\\\" is, of course, the first one. Somehow, it seems inadequate.\",\n",

He was 69. \\n\\n\\\"We are deeply saddened by the loss of a great actor and a wonderful man,\\\" said his publicist, Lori De Waal, in a statement Monday. \\\"Dennis Farina was always warmhearted and professional, with a great sense of humor and passion for his profession. He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and colleagues.\\\" \\n\\nFarina, who had a long career as a police officer in Chicago, got into acting through director Michael Mann, who used him as a consultant and cast him in his 1981 movie, \\\"Thief.\\\" That role led to others in such Mann-created shows as \\\"Miami Vice\\\" (in which Farina played a mobster) and \\\"Crime Story\\\" (in which he starred as Lt. Mike Torello). \\n\\nFarina also had roles, generally as either cops or gangsters, in a number of movies, including \\\"Midnight Run\\\" (1988), \\\"Get Shorty\\\" (1995), \\\"The Mod Squad\\\" (1999) and \\\"Snatch\\\" (2000). \\n\\nIn 2004, he joined the cast of the long-running \\\"Law & Order\\\" after Jerry Orbach's departure, playing Detective Joe Fontana, a role he reprised on the spinoff \\\"Trial by Jury.\\\" Fontana was known for flashy clothes and an expensive car, a distinct counterpoint to Orbach's rumpled Lennie Briscoe. \\n\\nFarina was on \\\"Law & Order\\\" for two years, partnered with Jesse L. Martin's Ed Green. Martin's character became a senior detective after Farina left the show. \",\n",

Kendra lives further from the bus stop than Quinton does, stops every morning at Quinton's house to join him to walk to the bus stop. Every afternoon, after school, when walking home from the bus stop they go in for cookies and milk that Quinton's mother has ready and waiting for them. Quinton can't eat cheese or cake so they had the same snack every day. They both work together on their homework and when they are done they play together. Kendra always makes sure to leave in time to get home for dinner. She doesn't want to miss story time which was right before bedtime. \\n\\nOne morning Kendra walked up to Quinton's house, she thought something might be wrong because normally Quinton was waiting outside for her and on this morning he was not to be found. Kendra went up to the door and knocked. She waited and waited and yet no one answered. She saw that Quinton's mother's car wasn't in their driveway which was weird. She waited for a few bit looking up and down the block and getting worried when Quinton was nowhere to be found. \\n\\nKendra didn't want to miss the bus to school and hurried off to make it in time. The bus driver saw that she was upset and that Quinton was not with her that morning. She told him what happened and he said that he was sure that everything would be okay. \\n\\nKendra got to school, ran to her teacher and told him what happened that morning. The teacher smiled and told her not to worry, Quinton's mother had called and he was going to the dentist and would be at school after lunch and that she would see him at the bus stop like normal tomorrow.\",\n",

The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.\"\n",

The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions. The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river Seine, but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine. The territory was roughly equivalent to the old province of Rouen, and reproduced the Roman administrative structure of Gallia Lugdunensis II (part of the former Gallia Lugdunensis).\"\n",

Having obtained the consent of pope Gregory VII and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After allying himself with Croatia and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of Albania, capturing Valona, Kanina, Jericho (Orikumi), and reaching Butrint after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquered Corfu and attacked Dyrrachium from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans. The Albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle because it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the command to a high Albanian official named Comiscortes in the service of Byzantium. The city's garrison resisted until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and Amalfitan merchants who had settled there. The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica. Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy. They lost Dyrrachium, Valona, and Butrint in 1085, after the death of Robert.\"\n",

Meanwhile, they occupied Petrela, the citadel of Mili at the banks of the river Deabolis, Gllavenica (Ballsh), Kanina and Jericho. This time, the Albanians sided with the Normans, dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the Byzantines had imposed upon them. With their help, the Normans secured the Arbanon passes and opened their way to Dibra. The lack of supplies, disease and Byzantine resistance forced Bohemond to retreat from his campaign and sign a peace treaty with the Byzantines in the city of Deabolis.\"\n",

He appointed Robert of Jumi\\u00e8ges archbishop of Canterbury and made Ralph the Timid earl of Hereford. He invited his brother-in-law Eustace II, Count of Boulogne to his court in 1051, an event which resulted in the greatest of early conflicts between Saxon and Norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of Earl Godwin of Wessex.\"\n",

Initially the Normans maintained a distinct culture and ethnicity. Yet, with time, they came to be subsumed into Irish culture to the point that it has been said that they became \\\"more Irish than the Irish themselves.\\\" The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of Ireland, later known as the Pale, and also built many fine castles and settlements, including Trim Castle and Dublin Castle. Both cultures intermixed, borrowing from each other's language, culture and outlook. Norman descendants today can be recognised by their surnames. Names such as French, (De) Roche, Devereux, D'Arcy, Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland, especially in the southern part of County Wexford where the first Norman settlements were established. Other Norman names such as Furlong predominate there. Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell (Murrell) derived from the French Norman name Morel. Other names beginning with Fitz (from the Norman for son) indicate Norman ancestry. These included Fitzgerald, FitzGibbons (Gibbons) dynasty, Fitzmaurice. Other families bearing such surnames as Barry (de Barra) and De B\\u00farca (Burke) are also of Norman extraction.\"\n",
